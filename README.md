# Overview of this Project:

One of the main tasks of an operating system is scheduling processes to run on the CPU. The goal of this project is to build a program to implement a simulator with different CPU
scheduling algorithms. The simulator should select a process to run from the ready queue based on the scheduling algorithm chosen at runtime. This program does not perform any actual process creation or execution.
